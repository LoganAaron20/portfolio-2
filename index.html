        <br>
        <p class="text-center">Ever since a kid, my dream was to work with technology. It just sounded very 
            ideal to me, considering I was always playing around with it. Since I kicked off my journey to learning my first language,
            I have been very captivated by all the information there is to learn about coding. One thing that keeps me motivated
            is a job that isn't easy, and developing has just what I need to fulfill that. 
            <br>
            <p class="text-center"> When I am not bunkered up trying to learn everything there is to know, I enjoy going 
                to the beach with my amazing girlfriend and my beautiful dog, Luna.
